### Hi I'm Mateusz
I am a passionate who loves to learn and turn lines of code into working solutions.

I am a Data Analysis Engineering Student at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Sciences at Warsaw University of Technology.

<!-- My skills, strengths, contact -->

What motivates me is the "oh wow, so that how it works" when I learn something new and satisfaction coming out of creative process of coding.

I have experience in *Java* (fairly advanced), *R* (fairly advanced), *Python* (advanced), *JavaScript* (intermediate), *Html* (fairly advanced) and *Css* (advanced). I am very good at problem solving which I consider a mental exercising.
